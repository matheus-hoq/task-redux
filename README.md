# My personal react template TS

This is my personal preferences on setting up a basic react project using Typescript.
Feel free to use this as your template.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn generate`

Create a react functional component with styling using styled components.

Create a new component on components folder.
